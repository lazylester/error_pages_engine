= ErrorPagesEngine

Implements in a Rails engine the Rails 3.2 pattern for dynamically-generated error pages. (see, for example http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2012/01/my-five-favorite-hidden-features-in-rails-3-2/)

One motivation for an engine implementation is the fact that the feature requires the Rails production environment configuration. This does not integrate well with an application's test suite.

The other motivation, of course, is it's DRY, and re-usable.
